# ✈️ AeroVision Strategic Analysis

This project analyzes public air traffic data from San Francisco International Airport (SFO) to identify strategic insights for AeroVision, a fictional airline company.

---

## 📊 Objective

To simulate how an airline company can leverage open data for operational and strategic decision-making, using SFO data as a proxy to analyze aircraft performance, international traffic patterns, and manufacturer relevance.

---

## 🧠 Business Questions

1. Which factors most influence international flight operations?
2. What is the probability that an aircraft type operates more than X times per year?
3. Which manufacturers account for the largest total landed weight?
4. Which aircraft types are most frequent per airline?
